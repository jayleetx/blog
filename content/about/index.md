title: Hi, I'm Jay!
---

And this is my blog. [Professionally](https://www.sightline.org/profile/jay-lee/), I'm a researcher in the realms of elections and public policy. Partially overlapping with that, I enjoy:
- Data science
- GIS and maps
- Election systems
- Riding my bike
- Cross stitching
- Dungeons and Dragons
- And more.

This blog is my attempt to do more writing in my personal life. Let's see if it works!
